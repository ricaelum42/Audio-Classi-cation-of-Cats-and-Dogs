# Audio-Classi-cation-of-Cats-and-Dogs
Winter 2018 STAT441 Final Project


## Summary
In2013, ImageNet launched a Kaggle challenge titled “Dogsvs. Cats” which focused on the problem of classifying images of cats and dogs. This popular challenge inspired the audio version of the Dogs vs. Cats classiﬁcation problem, the Kaggle dataset “Audio Cats and Dogs”. The goal of this project is to build and compare classiﬁers for this audio dataset using techniques typically used to extract useful features of audio data. Algorithms such as Adaboost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression with L1 Regularization, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks were explored.
